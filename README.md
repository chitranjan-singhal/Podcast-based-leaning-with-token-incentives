PodcastDiscovery - Decentralized Podcast Platform with Reward System

## Project Description
PodcastDiscovery is a decentralized platform for podcast creators and listeners, built on the Ethereum blockchain. The platform allows creators to upload their podcasts and episodes, and listeners to earn rewards for listening to episodes. The rewards are distributed in the form of ERC-20 tokens, and listeners can earn additional rewards by watching ads while listening. The contract ensures transparency, fair rewards distribution, and incentivizes engagement with content.

## Project Vision
The vision of PodcastDiscovery is to create an ecosystem where podcast creators are incentivized for their content, and listeners are rewarded for their engagement. This platform will provide a new way to monetize podcasting while fostering a community that values both creators and listeners. The project aims to empower content creators and listeners, providing a decentralized solution for the podcasting industry.

### Key Features:
- **Podcast Creation**: Creators can easily create podcasts and add episodes, each with a title, description, and reward mechanism.
- **Episode Monetization**: Each episode can be monetized with a reward for listeners, allowing creators to set how much users will earn for each listen.
- **Ad Rewards**: Listeners can earn additional rewards for watching ads while listening to episodes, incentivizing engagement.
- **Reward System**: Listeners are rewarded with ERC-20 tokens for engaging with the content. Rewards are calculated based on the episode's listen count and whether the listener watched an ad.
- **Reward Claiming**: Listeners can claim their accumulated rewards in the form of tokens (ERC-20) at any time.
- **Decentralized Ownership**: The contract is owned by the creator/deployer, who can manage the platform and ensure its continued operation.

### How It Works:
1. **Podcast Creation**: Creators publish their podcasts with a title and description.
2. **Episode Creation**: Creators add episodes to their podcast and set the reward for each listen and ad engagement.
3. **Listeners**: Users can listen to podcasts, and for each episode, they will receive rewards based on the creator's settings and if they watch an ad.
4. **Claiming Rewards**: Listeners can claim their accumulated rewards at any time by transferring the ERC-20 tokens to their wallet.

## Technologies Used:
- Ethereum Blockchain (Smart Contracts)
- Solidity Programming Language
- ERC-20 Token Standard
- OpenZeppelin Contracts (for ERC-20 and Ownable functionality)


2. **Interacting with the Contract**:
   - Once deployed, interact with the contract using a wallet such as MetaMask.
   - Use the functions to create podcasts, add episodes, and listen to episodes to earn rewards.

3. **Claiming Rewards**:
   - Listeners can use the `claimRewards()` function to claim their accumulated rewards in the ERC-20 token.
